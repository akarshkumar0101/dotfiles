# dotfiles
My personal config files!
Has files for .bashrc, .zshrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig, .tmux.conf, etc.


To install this, run ```bash install.sh```.
Look into this final for additional commands you may need to run.

This installs zsh, nvim, tmux, etc. config files that are independent files (not symlinks) but they source to this repo.
Then, I can also use computer-specific commands within the config file after sourcing.

For iterm2, just import the iterm2.json within iterm2's preferences.
